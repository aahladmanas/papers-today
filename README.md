1. 4/10   
    1. First Manifold experiment after 100 epochs, reconstruction is not great.
    2. Set multiple inpainting GAN experiments to check whether the old results are reproducible at this stage.
    3. Continued default COVIDomaly auto-encoder experiment. Ran until 600 epochs
    4. Set different COVIDomaly experiments on 64x64 images, 64 latent dim, and l1loss.
1.4/11  
    1. [Inpainting GAN] Saw that default hyperparams + larger LR was getting decent generation at 64x64.
    2. [Inpainting GAN] Using this set of default hyperparams + LR in (1e-3, 1e-4), set experiments with conditional generation. Seem to be going well.
    3. [ERM on reconstructed images]
    4. [Manifold-flow]: Look at manifold-flow architecture, and set other manifold-flow experiments
